# tumblr-portfolio-theme

Feel free to use this theme for your next portfolio! Example website at http://sanatrath.tumblr.com

## FYI
This tumblr theme supports only text posts. No other post type would be displayed. 

## Adding thumbnails
While starting a text post, add an image and a paragraph text to the top of the post. Then add a 'keep reading' link. The first image will show up as a thumbnail, the paragraph text below it would be the description below the thumbnail.  

## Add a about page
Add a new page called /about. Use standard layout and add content to the page! 
There are some specific classes that you can reuse in the /about page. 

Creating a split view: 
<div class="resume">
<h3>Experience</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Title<br /></strong><em>Dates<br /></em>Detail</li></ul>
</div>

Adding a 'download' button:  
<p class="download"><a href="#" target="_blank">Download resume</a></p>
